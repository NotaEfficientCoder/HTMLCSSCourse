# HTMLCSSCourse

This repository is for a project I made when I wanted to start learning HTML and CSS. The project itself is youtube.html and the CSS for it can be found in the styles folder. The rest of the content was to practice the skills needed to design the clone.

It was made with the help of a youtuber by the name of SuperSimpleDev. You can check out the course video he made on Youtube here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc

The project features creating a clone of the homepage of Youtube which features several foundational HTML and CSS skills.
