# HTMLCSSCourse

This repository is for a project I made when I wanted to start learning HTML and CSS.

It was made with the help of a youtuber by the name of SuperSimpleDev. You can check out the course video he made on Youtube here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc

The project features creating a clone of the homepage of Youtube which features several foundational HTML and CSS skills.
